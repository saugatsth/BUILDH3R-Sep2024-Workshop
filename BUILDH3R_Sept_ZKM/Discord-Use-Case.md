# Discord Use Case

## zkMIPS for Healthcare Data Sharing
### Problem
Businesses offering loyalty programs often collect sensitive user data (e.g., purchase history, location) to manage rewards and offer personalized experiences. This can create privacy concerns for customers who don’t want their entire purchase history exposed.

### Solution: zkMIPS-Based Private Loyalty Programs
With zkMIPS, businesses can manage loyalty programs in a way that preserves user privacy. Customers can earn and redeem points without revealing sensitive data such as specific purchases or personal information.

- Loyalty Points Accumulation:
  Users’ purchases are processed by a zkMIPS program, which generates a proof that:
    - Confirms a purchase was made.
    - Calculates the correct loyalty points earned.
    - Does not reveal any details about the purchase.

- Proof Submission:
  The zkMIPS proof is submitted to an on-chain contract that:
	- Verifies the loyalty points calculation.
	- Confirms the points can be redeemed without revealing the user’s specific purchase history.

- Redeeming Points:
  Users can redeem points based on their zkMIPS proof, maintaining privacy while still enjoying rewards.

### Why zkMIPS for Loyalty Programs?
- Privacy: Users’ purchase histories remain confidential, even as they earn and redeem loyalty points.
- Security: zkMIPS ensures loyalty points are calculated correctly without exposing sensitive customer data.
- Customization: Businesses can still personalize offers based on verified loyalty points without needing access to personal purchase details.

### Solution Components
- zkMIPS: Generates cryptographic proofs for loyalty point accumulation and redemption.
- Smart Contract: Verifies the zkMIPS proof for loyalty point validation on-chain.
- Golang & Rust: Used to develop the zkMIPS loyalty program module.
